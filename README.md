# React Notepad Frontend: SOLID Architecture with Repository Pattern

A modern React frontend application built with **SOLID principles** and **Repository Pattern**, featuring authentication and rich text note-taking capabilities. This application demonstrates clean architecture principles in frontend development using React, Redux, and Material-UI.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a comprehensive note-taking application frontend that provides:
- **User Authentication** (Register/Login with JWT)
- **Rich Text Note Editor** with WYSIWYG capabilities
- **Notes Management** (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- **Search & Pagination** for efficient note browsing
- **Responsive Design** optimized for all devices
- **Clean Architecture** following SOLID principles

**Purpose**: Demonstrate how to build scalable, maintainable React applications using enterprise-level architectural patterns typically seen in backend development.

## 🏗️ SOLID Principles Implementation

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Where**: Each component, service, and repository has one clear responsibility

**Examples**:
- `LoginForm`: Handles only login form UI and validation
- `AuthService`: Manages only authentication business logic
- `HttpService`: Handles only HTTP communication
- `NoteRepository`: Manages only note-related API calls

**Benefits**:
- Components are easier to test and maintain
- Changes in one area don't cascade to others
- Clear code organization and readability

---

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**Where**: Interfaces allow extension without modification

**Examples**:
- `IRepository<T>` interface can be extended for new entities
- `IHttpService` allows different HTTP client implementations
- Component props interfaces enable extension without breaking changes

**Benefits**:
- New features can be added without modifying existing code
- Easy to add new repository types or HTTP clients

---

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**Where**: Implementations can be substituted for their interfaces

**Examples**:
- `AuthRepository` implements `IAuthRepository` and can be replaced
- `HttpService` implements `IHttpService` and is substitutable
- Mock implementations can replace real ones in testing

**Benefits**:
- Easy to swap implementations (e.g., switch from Axios to Fetch)
- Seamless testing with mock objects

---

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**Where**: Small, focused interfaces instead of large monolithic ones

**Examples**:
- `IAuthRepository` has only auth-related methods
- `INoteRepository` has only note-related methods
- `IPaginatedRepository<T>` focuses only on pagination concerns

**Benefits**:
- Components depend only on methods they actually use
- Reduced coupling and cleaner interfaces

---

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**Where**: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions

**Examples**:
- `AuthService` depends on `IAuthRepository` (injected)
- `NoteService` depends on `INoteRepository` (injected)
- Redux thunks depend on injected services

**Benefits**:
- Loose coupling between layers
- Easy testing with dependency injection
- Better flexibility and maintainability

---

## 🗂️ Repository Pattern Implementation

### Where it's used:
- `IBaseRepository<T>`: Generic contract for all repositories
- `IAuthRepository`, `INoteRepository`: Feature-specific interfaces
- `AuthRepository`, `NoteRepository`: Concrete implementations
- `IPaginatedRepository<T>`: Specialized interface for pagination

### How it helps:
- **API Abstraction**: Business logic doesn't depend on HTTP client specifics
- **Testability**: Easy to mock repositories for unit testing
- **Flexibility**: Can switch between different API clients or data sources
- **Consistency**: All data access follows the same patterns
- **Caching**: Easy to add caching layer without changing business logic

## 🚀 Features

- **Authentication**: Login/Register with JWT tokens
- **Rich Text Editor**: WYSIWYG editor using CKEditor 5
- **Notes Management**: Create, read, update, delete notes
- **Search & Pagination**: Search notes and paginated results
- **Responsive Design**: Material-UI components with responsive layout
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
- **Protected Routes**: Route-level authentication guards

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management
- **Material-UI (MUI)** for UI components
- **React Router** for navigation
- **CKEditor 5** for rich text editing
- **Axios** for HTTP requests
- **Vite** for build tooling

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```ts
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```ts
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for production:**
   ```ts
   npm run build
   ```

## 🔌 Backend Integration

This frontend is designed to work with the NestJS backend. Make sure the backend is running on `http://localhost:3000`.

The frontend uses a proxy configuration in Vite to forward API requests:
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3001`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:3000`
- API calls are made to `/api/*` and proxied to the backend

## 🎯 Key Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern
```ts
// Interface defines the contract
interface INoteRepository {
  findAll(): Promise<Note[]>;
  create(data: CreateNoteRequest): Promise<Note>;
  // ... other methods
}

// Implementation handles HTTP calls
class NoteRepository implements INoteRepository {
  constructor(private httpService: IHttpService) {}
  
  async findAll(): Promise<Note[]> {
    return this.httpService.get<Note[]>('/notes');
  }
}
```

### Dependency Injection
```ts
// Services depend on abstractions, not concrete classes
class NoteService {
  constructor(private noteRepository: INoteRepository) {}
}

// Dependencies are injected at the container level
const noteRepository = new NoteRepository(httpService);
const noteService = new NoteService(noteRepository);
```

### Redux with Services
```ts
// Redux thunks use injected services
export const fetchNotesAsync = createAsyncThunk(
  'notes/fetchNotes',
  async (params: GetNotesParams) => {
    return await noteService.getNotes(params);
  }
);
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

The architecture supports easy testing through:

- **Mocked Repositories**: Replace real repositories with mocks
- **Service Testing**: Test business logic independently
- **Component Testing**: Test UI components in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: Test feature workflows end-to-end

- **Memoization**: React.memo for expensive components
- **Debounced Search**: Optimized search input handling
- **Pagination**: Efficient data loading

## 🔄 State Management

Redux Toolkit with feature-based slices:
- **Auth Slice**: User authentication state
- **Notes Slice**: Notes data and UI state
- **Typed Hooks**: Type-safe Redux hooks
- **Async Thunks**: Standardized async operations

## 🎨 UI/UX Features
